# SMS Spam Detection

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting spam messages in SMS data. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation steps. The model is designed to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam).

## Introduction

SMS spam detection is an important task to filter out unwanted messages and improve user experience. This project uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify SMS messages into spam and ham categories.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing SMS data for modeling.
- Feature extraction: Transforming text data into numerical features using techniques such as TF-IDF.
- Model training: Implementing machine learning algorithms to train a spam detection model.
- Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using various metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [SMS Spam Collection Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains a set of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sms-spam-detection.git
    cd sms-spam-detection
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the dataset file (`SMSSpamCollection`) in the `data/` directory. If not, download it from the provided link and place it there.

2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```

3. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

4. Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate_model.py
    ```

## Model Training

The model training script (`train_model.py`) performs the following steps:

1. Loads and preprocesses the data.
2. Extracts features using TF-IDF vectorization.
3. Trains a classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or another algorithm).
4. Saves the trained model to disk.

## Evaluation

The evaluation script (`evaluate_model.py`) loads the trained model and evaluates its performance on a test set using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are printed to the console.
